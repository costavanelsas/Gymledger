        Also you can add the weight that you are doing while doing the exercise.
        This app will be for everyone who goes to the gym.
        This app creates the opportunity to get all your data in one app and create a clear view of which exercise and how many sets/reps and the amount of weight.
        The App will also save the date for which you can see a graph later. The graphs represent the gains that you have made.
        The app will generate recommendations on which exercise you will do and with the amount of weight/reps/sets.
